# Additional Analytics & Conclusion

Test Accuracy: Gradient Boosting achieved the highest test accuracy of 0.869565.

Precision and Recall Balance: Decision Tree showed a high precision score of 0.932584, while Random Forest exhibited a high recall score of 0.892157.

Overall Balance: Gradient Boosting demonstrated a good balance between precision (0.897959) and recall (0.862745) with a relatively high F1 score of 0.880000. Thus, prioritizing overall performance considering both precision and recall, Gradient Boosting appears to be the best model among those listed.

Scope of Future Work: Integrating ECG analytics could potentially improve predictions, leading to higher accuracies and potentially saving lives on humanitarian grounds. There is scope for further exploration and enhancement in future work.
